3 Team: Individual assignment.
4 Time: About 16 hours.
5 Recommended version and screen size: API 19 or higher and any-size screen can be used.
6 It took me so long because I was having technical difficulties left and right.
Serializable not working correctly, onSave/RestoreInstanceState was overriding the wrong method (please let Vidya know not to have
persistableBundle as part of the overwritten methods), and general bug-fixing with the Runnable.
